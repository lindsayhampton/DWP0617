				<p>The Full Sail Zoo was a marketing video made for RMO in which we were provided with different animal clips and required to create an advertisement for a zoo. My friend Lorenzo recorded me a ukulele riff to use in the background as I edited some of the clips and recorded voiceovers in order to give the advertisement a real commercial-esque feel.</p>


				<h5 id="no2">Image File Types Informative Video</h5>

				<p>The Image File Types video was an informative piece created for RMO in which we were required to discuss some sort of image optimization. I decided to discuss image file types and the differences between them, specifically JPEG, GIF, and PNG. </p>


				<h5 id="no3">While You Were Out - A Stop Motion Animation</h5>

				<br>
				<p>This video, titled "While You Were Out", is a Stop Motion Animation created by me in 2011 for a project class in my high school. Each shot was taken with a Nikon D3100 frame by frame and edited together to make one complete motion sequence. </p>
